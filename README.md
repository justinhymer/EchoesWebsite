TODO:

- Add animation to page so that text appears that it's being typed out at you
<!-- - Make font bigger -- NOTE: Changing font affects everything which is throwing off displayTitle().  -->
- Format the help pages to look more like standard help pages
- Have user navigation need "cd" {directory} to go to different screens
  - "cd .." takes user back one directory
- program in {command} help screens for every specific command
  - For example, "cd help" or "help cd" would show how to use the cd command
- same for "ls"
- program "pwd" functionality
- Code in directory structure
  - If on "this" page, then show "these" files/folders if user types "ls" in that directory
