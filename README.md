TODO:

- Add animation to page so that text appears that it's being typed out at you
- Make font bigger
- Currently, if console text fills up the box, the user can't scroll down. Originally there was a scrollbar that I removed. That functionality was added in the CSS in the 'pre' block with overflow-y property. This may need to be changed, and just somehow hide the scrollbar a different way
- Format the help pages to look more like standard help pages
- Have user navigation need "cd" {directory} to go to different screens
    - "cd .." takes user back one directory
- program in {command} help screens for every specific command
    - For example, "cd help" or "help cd" would show how to use the cd command
- same for "ls"
- program "pwd" functionality
- Have in the user input box "C:\>" to mimic command line
- Code in directory structure
    - If on "this" page, then show "these" files/folders if user types "ls" in that directory
